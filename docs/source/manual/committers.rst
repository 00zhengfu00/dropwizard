Dropwizard Committers

The list of committers is kept in the developer section of the pom.xml
located in the parent directory.

Committer Rules
================

* Committers aren't allowed to merge their own changes, the exception being bug fixes
* A commit may be reverted, but it requires 2+ committer's approval. The goal is to keep it democratic
